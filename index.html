      <h2>Always stay disciplined, and focused</h2>
      <p>A lack of discipline and focus would lead to non-productivity in your life.</p>

      <h2>Never be afraid of anything because fear puts you out of balance with yourself</h2>
      <p>Fear is a vibration that the universe laughs at. The gods would never respect a fearful being. In the animal kingdom, fearful entities do not survive long. A dog would attack you if you are afraid, but if you show courage, it would leave you alone.</p>

      <h2>Always be grateful and humble</h2>
      <p>Being grateful everyday that you are alive is something to greatly appreciate, because people die everyday. A humble person has a tamed ego, so be humble.</p>

      <h2>Keep a strong moral compass</h2>
      <p>Never allow emotions such as envy, hate, or anger to enter your life. Take life very seriously, grow your own garden. Never stick your nose in other's gardens. Do not be a cancer or parasite on the planet. Be the hardest working person in your family.</p>

      <h2>Respect yourself and others</h2>
      <p>In the world we live in today, many young adults suffer with low-self esteem because of a lack of self-respect and security. This lack of self-respect is normally brought on from growing up inside of a toxic household or poor environment overall, perhaps the parents didn't teach much moral values or abused their kids. Don't judge others based on race or ethnicity, judge them based on their character. You are who you hang out with, make sure they are a positive group of individuals who are productive with their lives. In mathematics, a " + " and a " - " will always = a " - ", therefore hanging with negative people will always lead to a negative lifestyle. </p>

      <h2>Mind your business, and ignore things you have no control over</h2>
      <p>There would be many things in life in which you would not like, but you would not be able do anything about it. Just focus on controlling what you can. Don't pay attention to the news, because a lot of the stories aren't true, and overall the news brings a negative low-frequency.</p>

      <h2>Always remember you are a human</h2>
      <p>A human being is highly advanced in the universe, gifted with the powers of creativity, freedom, understanding, love and much more. This elevates man into gods and we should greatly appreciate that we are at the top of the food chain on planet Earth. Never allow yourself to fall to the level of an animal, which is a lower life-form than you. An animal does not have the morals and creative mind that a human does.</p>

        A great british writer wrote a story long ago. A story which can be compared to our society today, called "Old devils letter to the Young". It goes like this... <br>

        "One young devil asked the old man: "How did you manage to bring so many souls to hell?" <br>

        The old devil answered: "I instilled fear in them!" <br>
        
        Answers the youngster: "Great job! And what were they afraid of? Wars? Hunger?" <br>
        
        Answers the man: "No, they were afraid of the disease!" <br>
        
        For this youngster: "Does this mean they didn't get sick? Are they not dead? There was no rescue for them?" <br>
        
        The old man answered: "But no ... they got sick, died, and the rescue was there." <br>
        
        The young devil, surprised, answered: "Then I don't understand?" <br>
        
        The old man answered: "You know they believed the only thing they have to keep at any cost is their lives. <br> They stopped hugging, greeting each other. They've moved away from each other. They gave up all social contacts and everything that was human! Later they ran out of money, lost their jobs, but that was their choice because they were afraid for their lives, that's why they quit their jobs without even having bread.
        
        "They believed blindly everything they heard and read in the papers. They gave up their freedoms, they didn't leave their own homes literally anywhere. They stopped visiting family and friends. The world turned into such a concentration camp, without forcing them into captivity. They accepted everything! Just to live at least one more miserable day ... And so living, they died every day! And that's how it was very easy for me to take their miserable souls to hell."
